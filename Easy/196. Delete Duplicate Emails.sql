-- Table: Person

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | email       | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key column for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

-- Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The query result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Person table:
-- +----+------------------+
-- | id | email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
-- | 3  | john@example.com |
-- +----+------------------+
-- Output: 
-- +----+------------------+
-- | id | email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
-- +----+------------------+
-- Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.


# Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.
# Write your MySQL query statement below

delete from Person
where Id not in (select * from (select min(Id) from Person group by email) as temp)

--solution-2
